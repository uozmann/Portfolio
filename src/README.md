## Concept Overview

The game I am going to develop for project II is part of the website “A lifetime in Circle” that narrates topics on parenting in chronological order: from childhood to parenthood. 

Across several stages of the life cycle, the infant stage is crucial and determinant for a person’s formation of the self. This period characterized by vulnerability, transformability, and learnability has life-long impacts that are hard to be erased. 

In 2008, the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS) reported the “rate of maltreatment-related investigations was 39.16 per 1,000 children and substantiated investigations was 14.19 per 1,000 children. As trauma in the early ages requires life-long healing, it is important to provide ways to address those situations and to demystify the stigmas and stereotypes around parenting and being parented. 

In general, parents who experienced early childhood trauma are prone to replicating those negative experiences on their children due to poor role modeling or a lack of positive references; some other parents may deliver ACEs (adverse childhood experiences) back to their children because of the mental and physical conditions that they carry through C-PTSD (Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders). 

In this website, I want to focus on the plurality of parenthood experiences, and look at the other side of the mirror where not all families live happily forever. I created this website to balance the mass preconception of parenting in hope to lead some less heard voices into this conversation.


## Origin and Insider Note

In 2022, I came across an article in Zhihu, an App where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by the community of Zhihu users. The article asks if the kids who committed suicide are worthy of the care given by their parents. My first reaction when seeing the post was like, oh true, their parents must have been so sad and deceived to learn the news, the kids did break some hearts. I expected the answers for this question to be somehow on the side of the parents, something in-line with "before killing yourself think about your parents and all they have given to you." However, to my surprise, among the 2623 response posts, the majority of the voices is in favor to the kids. The general idea is, the main reason of people committing suicide at such a young age comes from the parents' abusive, toxic, negligeant behaviour towards their children.

After reading quite some answers, I realized I have so many pre-conceptions on the topic of parenting that I don't necessarily agree with, but that I never really questionned. This was the start of the website, as I want to know about the reality out there, and re-picture the idea of parent-child relationship aside from the bubbly and happy images I have always been taught. However, during my researches, I noticed that even if I can find some more objective/diversified information, they still can't represent the global situation, so I decided to approach this topic by creating a virtual reality that gathers those information and that is representated by those information. I adopted this fiction-orientated aesthetic in order to hint at this new approach.

2. Simulation:

    >>This part contains all the interractive life simulation


## Gameplay:

The idea is to allow the players to simulate a lifetime by going through each scene for the life stage. Version 0, the egg mascot, will guide the player through each stage, and when clicked, will bring the player towards the direction they should go. The player has control over where he goes, so they can also decide to explore the space as they want, and return to try each simulation multiple times in order to experience a different life.

The core idea is to allow them to reflect on and live some new life experiences that they might not be familiar with, and to make the researches and statistics take sense.

## Aesthetic Decision:

I have started with a realistic modelling of the characters for each scene. I tried to model the characters as "normal" and as "universal" as they can be, because I did not want to under-represent a certain type of gender, race, or culture. However, I realized it is almost impossible to do so, because I have only four scenes, but there are so much more different types of people in the world. So I ended up with the idea of portraying characters with geometric shapes, going from the shapes with less angle (to represent children) to the shapes with more angles (to represent adults). 

Inside the semi-transparent wall, there are many other geometries, that to me, are like all those people who share similar experiences, and who are watching you going through each of their life stages and learn about their reality.
